                </h2>
                <p class="text-justify mt-4 mb-4">
                    CoronaFACTS was founded by Dr. Kevin Carr. He is the Chief Executive Officer of the 
                    National Coordination Center and its supporting shared services entity, Edera, in 
                    Washington, D.C. The National Coordination Center is a collective of public and 
                    private sector advisors who leverage the advantages of partnership and collaboration 
                    to solve complex healthcare issues.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify mt-4 mb-4">
                    Dr. Carr is passionate about developing and executing clear and viable strategies 
                    that improve healthcare practices and processes for patients. His vision – connecting 
                    the brightest minds in healthcare to drive transformative change – came to fruition 
                    when he collaborated with visionary individuals from Yale University, the Center for 
                    Medical Interoperability in Nashville, TN, not-for-profit Inova Health System in Falls 
                    Church, VA, and The Harold P. Freeman Patient Navigation Institute in New York City. 
                    The tactical steps Dr. Carr and his highly experienced colleagues create 
                    collaboratively lead to sustainable results and measurable outcomes.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify mt-4 mb-4">
                    The National Coordination Center is built on the premise that individuals can maximize 
                    their positive effect on the healthcare industry when they work together on large 
                    transformations within an enterprise or across enterprises. To that end, the NCC 
                    reinvests profits from the projects it supports into mission-focused priorities for 
                    its clients. For example, NCC is implementing a minority medical informatics internship 
                    for U.S. veterans in collaboration with Cerner Corporation of North Kansas City, MO.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify mt-4 mb-5">
                    Dr. Carr grew up in Alabama where a childhood experience with cancer motivated him to 
                    seek a career in medicine. He served on Yale School of Medicine faculty after 
                    completing his residency. While there, he formed a multi-stakeholder collaborative to 
                    implement a charity care network with centralized care management services for 
                    uninsured patients. He also served at the Chief Medical Information Officer of a 
                    Yale-affiliated hospital.
